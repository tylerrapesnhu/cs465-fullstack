Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Initially, our project began working with Express with some previously created HTML pages for the customer-side. These were nicely presented using the Node.JS webserver. We then began making tweaks to what we were given so that so much code wasn't being repeasted through handlebars. Finally, we created our SPA. This was handled through Angular. 
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
NoSQL MongoDB was chosen because of its flexibilty. SQL can require strict data input. 

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation and is used for exchanging information between a client and a server. Jacascript a language. Both were used in this project. 
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
In this project, we refactored many files. One example is the travel.html/travel.hbs file. We removed teh duplication of headers and footers to make reusable components.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
In our application, we used Postman to test API endpoints. We utilzed it for creating new trips, editing trips and adding users through GET, POST, and PUT. We verified  tokens for security through Postman as well. 

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has helped me in reaching my professional goals though developing a full stack web application from begining to end. It helped me expand my knowledge of MongoDB and working with databases in general. It helped me understand UI even better. Finally, I feel that I am much better equipted at testing APIs.
